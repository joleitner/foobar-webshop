# FooBar Webshop

### By 'joleitner'

This project is demonstrating the successful implementation of a cloud-based webshop for the so called 'FooBar GmbH'.
It uses the latest version of Next.js 13 as the frontend, and Nest.js as the backend. Both are written in TypeScript.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, clone the repository and navigate into the `webshop-joleitner` directory. Then, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will start the project and make it available at http://localhost:3000.
